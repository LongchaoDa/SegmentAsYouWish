## Extra Modality Extension

In this case study, we tend to verify the performance in an extra modality - MRI. 

The shown image `MRI.jpg` is from the CHAOS dataset in pre-split test set. We could observe that, even though such modality is a rare portation in the training set, our model `FLanS` still performs well in understanding the intention of the text-prompt and align it with the visual features in the new modality image.
